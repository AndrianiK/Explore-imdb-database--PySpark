## Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon & Engineering the Perfect cast
### Big Data Analytics Project
Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon is a game based on the "six degrees of separation" concept, which posits that any two people on earth are six or fewer acquaintance links apart. It rests on the assumption that 
anyone involved in the film industry can be linked through their film roles to Bacon within six steps. 

The analysis of social networks can be a computationally intensive task, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. It is also a challenging problem to devise a correct methodology to infer an informative social network structure. 

Here, we will analyze a social network of actors and actresses that co-participated in movies. We will do some simple descriptive analysis, and in the end try to relate an actor/actressâ€™s position in the social network with the success of the movies in which they participate.

*The questions include creating dataframes, converting them to RDDs (map and reduce), listing all links of the network and working with GraphFrames.
